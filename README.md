# luci-app-accesscontrol
Original Version is Here:
https://github.com/k-szuster/luci-access-control
This has been updated and tested to work with CC, DD and Trunk,
Whereas the original is tested only with BB and CC.

The previous version also required custom edits to 
 /openwrt/feeds/luci/contrib/package/luci-addons/Makefile

However now all you need to do to test and install is to add a link to the files in feeds.conf.
